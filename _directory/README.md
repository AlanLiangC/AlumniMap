# How to add and manage your entry

The project is hosted at GitHub, which allows for everyone to add and manage their map entries by themselves! This is pretty cool.

Learn about 3 ways to manage your entry:

## 1. Send a pull request

__This is the best option:__ fork the repo, add or update your entry and send a pull request. Once merged, it will be live on the map! ðŸ’¯

## 2. Open an issue

Second best option: if youâ€™re not familiar with forking and pull request, just open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/community/issues) with your data inside. Weâ€™ll take care and add your data to the map.

## 3. Contact us

Worst option, but no worries, weâ€™d love to help! If you donâ€™t have a GitHub account at all or you don not feel comfortable to open an issue containing your data, just send it to us. __Email:__ _friendsof [at] redaxo.org_

Btw: which data? ðŸ‘‡

## Data structure

Have a look at the example file [`.data.example.yml`](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/community/blob/master/_directory/.data.example.yml). Aside from dummy data it contains a lot of __helpful comments__ on how to structure your data!
